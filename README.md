I successfully designed and developed a personal portfolio website that reflects my skills and professional identity as a web developer. The project involved creating a responsive and interactive web page using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. I incorporated key sections such as an introduction, about me, skills, projects, and contact details, ensuring each element was visually appealing and functional. I utilized advanced CSS features like linear gradients, hover effects, and smooth transitions to enhance the user experience. JavaScript was implemented to add interactive effects such as button scaling and hover animations.
